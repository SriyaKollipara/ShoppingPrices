# ShoppingPrices
*DSA Project 3*

The purpose of this Python Project is to use heaps to gain an understanding about consumer spending. The GUI uses data to retrieve the highest and lowest priced purchases. This is helpful for users to sort and retrieve information.

To run the program you must install the **PySimpleGUI** Library

Once you run the python product_UI.py application you can click two buttons. The Find Lowest Price button will display the details of the order with the lowest price. The Find Highest Price Button will display the details along with the highest price of the purchase.
